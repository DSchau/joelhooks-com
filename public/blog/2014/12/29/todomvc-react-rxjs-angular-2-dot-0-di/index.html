<p>There&rsquo;s a great post from <a href="http://merrickchristensen.com/articles/react-angular-di.html">Merrick Christensen</a> that explores the idea of using Angular 2.0&rsquo;s DI tool with the React framework. Why would you do this? Well, depndency injection solves a very real problem when writing tests. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to test things when you can replace their dependencies cleanly and easily without a lot of configuration.</p>

<p>di.js is a bit rough around the edges. It is very much under development, but it is actually usable today.</p>

<p>Merrick shows that the idea is possible, but stops at a proof of concept. How would this look in a real application, or at the very least the ubiquitous TodoMVC?</p>
