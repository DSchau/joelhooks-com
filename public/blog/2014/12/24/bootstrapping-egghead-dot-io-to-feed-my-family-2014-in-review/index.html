		<h1>2014 Year in Review</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year. People dusting off the blog and endeavoring to capture the past 12 months of their life in a wordy nutshell. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve never participated in, but I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>

<h2>I quit my job.</h2>

<p>This still frightens me. In February I quit a job that paid very well and provided a steady stream of work. This goes against the very core of my being, but it had to happen. It was killing my focus on what I truly wanted to do.</p>

<h2>Building egghead.io</h2>

<p>In late 2013 I partnered up with my friend John Lindquist to convert his <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io website</a> from a list of YouTube videos into a subscription service providing short topical video lessons to web developers several times per week.</p>

<p>One of my first orders of business was to introduce additional content producers to teach material, as burning John out is something I plan to avoid. Initially I produced some lessons, but through the course of the year I&rsquo;ve tapered that off to focus on the business side of the business.</p>

<p>This has turned out very well, and we&rsquo;ve had many instructors contribute content throughout the year. It is surprisingly difficult to produce a 2-10 minute concise lesson in screencast form, so the instructors tend to work in bursts.</p>

<p>To date, <strong>we&rsquo;ve paid just over $100,000 in royalties to our instructors</strong>.</p>

<p>This makes me so freaking proud. It&rsquo;s amazing, and when I looked at the numbers and saw that, it was hard to believe.</p>

<p>In May, John was able to leave his (beloved) job to work on egghead fulltime as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving my dream job to work at my dream dream job,&rdquo; is what he told me.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve built a platform that allows smart people to teach other smart people what they know and receive non-trivial compensation for their work.</p>

<p>This. More of this.</p>

<h2>Improving egghead.io</h2>

<p>While my initial &ldquo;design&rdquo; for egghead was OK, it was plain-old-boostrap, and generally kind of meh. But, they call <strong>bootstrap</strong> bootstrap for a reason. We are bootstrapping a business, spending just what we have to and delivering value.</p>

<p>As revenues have increased, I&rsquo;ve been able to slowly build a team. This has been wonderful, because building something by yourself gets very very lonely.</p>

<p>Our team is modular. We hire consultants, and pay them monthly retainers for blocks of work. The first was the wonderful <a href="http://uibreakfast.com/">Jane Portman</a> to start refreshing the overall design.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m terrible at it, and hate it, we hired Evgeniy Nagalskiy to take Jane&rsquo;s designs and convert them to HTML and SCSS for me. This has allowed the designs to actually see the light of day, instead of being a constant source of dread for me.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also been able to engage Pete Keen, who wrote the book on <a href="https://www.masteringmodernpayments.com/">Stripe payments with Rails</a> that saved my ass when building the initial Stripe integration. He&rsquo;s been a huge help on the Rails side, considering I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing most of the time ;)</p>

<p>We also got some help from Matt Jaynes, who built a killer <a href="https://devopsu.com/">Vagrant/Ansible VM</a> for egghead local development.</p>

<p>This is fun and exciting, and 2015 is going to be awesome.</p>

<h2>Teaching AngularJS on-location</h2>

<p>By February, egghead.io revenue was nowhere near the level to match my consulting income and feed my family. To supplement the missing income, I started doing <a href="https://egghead.io/angularjs-enterprise-training-workshop">in-person training of web developers</a> for companies. This has been a lot of fun, keeping me engaged with lots of smart people around the country. I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it at a sane level, but I&rsquo;ve hit the 2nd tier of airline status for the first time ever&hellip; lots of travel!</p>

<p>The first few times were very tough. I&rsquo;ve done workshops, but they were free conference workshops. These companies pay me a very high rate to teach their staff the ins-and-outs of AngularJS in 2 to 3 days.</p>

<p>It is hard work, and I&rsquo;ll likely wind it down through 2015 as I focus on egghead.</p>

<h2>Writing&hellip;</h2>

<p>For most of the year I&rsquo;ve been slowly writing a book on <a href="https://egghead.io/essential-angularjs-grunt-build">AngularJS Automation with Grunt</a>. By the end of this year it will be complete, and I will start on the Gulp version.</p>

<p>For the most part, it serves as a source of guilt. Something I should be working on, but I&rsquo;m not. I should take this as a sign?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve neglected my blog and email list as well. I&rsquo;ve been totally engrossed with building the egghead business, that I&rsquo;ve kind of let this space fizzle.</p>

<p>Writing is something I enjoy, so I will get back at it. I&rsquo;m in a weird middle space where I feel like I&rsquo;ve got interesting things to say about bootstrapping a business over technical topics. The problem is I lack confidence, which isn&rsquo;t rational, because by any measure I&rsquo;ve got some experience in the area now.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I was all over the US in 2014 for the training. My favorite trips were probably to San Francisco. Love the energy and concentrated intelligence in that city.</p>

<p>John and I got to deliver workshops in Paris for ng-europe. This was very exciting for me, as I&rsquo;ve never been to France. Paris is amazing, and I will definitely go back. The highlight was a culinary tour by the awesome <a href="http://www.uteinparis.com/WELCOME.html">Ute Biefang</a>. If you like food and are heading to Paris, you should book a tour. It was <strong>fantastic</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/best_meal_2015.jpg" alt="best meal of 2015, hands down" /></p>

<p>This summer we went on a cross-country road trip with our 4 children. It was an epic journey to Vermont via Tennesee, NYC, and Boston.</p>

<p><img src="/images/times_square.jpg" alt="apparently a cricket lives here" /></p>

<p>In NYC my 7 year old daughter saw a &ldquo;family&rdquo; of rats in Central Park and exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream come true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of her favorite books, A Cricket in Times Square, feature a mouse that gets his meals in Central Park. heh</p>

<p><img src="/images/lake_view.jpg" alt="lovely..." /></p>

<p>This was our morning view for two weeks. Lake Champlain is awesome. We are going back next year.</p>

<h2>Driving fast!</h2>

<p>I spent a weekend at a High Performance Driver Education track event. It was <strong>freaking amazing</strong>. So much fear. So much fun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/racing_2015.jpg" alt="vrroooooom" /></p>

<p>It was very challenging to drive into corners at speeds your mind <strong>knows</strong> are not &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, pushing the car to the limits. Highly recommended to anybody, with any vehicle. I love to drive, and thought I was good at it. I learned how little I actually know, even after 25 years of driving. The weekend improved my driving skills immensely, making me more aware of both my vehicle and the road around me.</p>

<h2>Stopped smoking for good&hellip;</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a love hate relationships with nicotine for many years. It&rsquo;s done. No vaping, no gum, no sneaking, just done. If you want to quit, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0718194551/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/">Allen Carrs Easy Way to Stop Smoking</a>. It is a great book that uses cognitive behavior therapy in an effective way.</p>

<p><strong>Fuck you cigarettes.</strong></p>

<h2>Lost 50 pounds&hellip;</h2>

<p>I lost 50 pounds, which is awesome. I&rsquo;ve slacked off a bit and am back up 10, but haven&rsquo;t regressed fully into old habits. This is something I&rsquo;d definitely like to keep up through 2015 and beyond, as it sure is nice to not have that extra weight. I used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0982207778/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/">Primal Blueprint</a> approach, and found it to be a moderate paleo that is sustainable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/smaller_joel.jpg" alt="smaller joel" /></p>

<p>For a brief period I was lifting weights too, and enjoying it. I was using bad form and did something to my elbow. It&rsquo;s hurt for many months, and I dread seeing a doctor because it will probably require cutting. Need to bite the bullet and just get it taken care of.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>2015 is going to be awesome. I&rsquo;ve got big plans for egghead, and look forward to many technical challenges alongside the business and marketing aspects that are fun too.</p>

<p>I plan on digging deep on reactive programming with React and RxJS while honing my functional programming skills at the same time. I&rsquo;d love to have a working knowledge of Clojure.</p>

<p>There will be more driving in my future as well. I plan on attending several HPDE events, as well as a 3-day off-road rally course at DirtFish. The latter I am particularly excited about!</p>

<p>Bring it New Year.</p>
