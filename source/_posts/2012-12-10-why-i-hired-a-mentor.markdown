In a perfect world I would casually meet interested professionals with deep wells of experience on a fairly frequent basis. These professionals would quickly befriend me and offer to listen to my struggles and offer sage advice, asking nothing in return; rewarded only by the deep joy that watching me blossom can provide. In the real world, the one that I live in, this has proven **not** to be the case. 

### Productivity, Financial Independence, and Lifestyle Design

I'm prone do a dark unhappiness. It isn't full-blown depression, but it is this feeling of "lack" that can creep into my thoughts. It affects me on many levels, and it's one of those things that I've always dealt with in a half-assed way and generally come out of it OK. When I step back and take stock, there is really not much to complain about. I'm always able to find something, but generally "life is good". So what's the deal? 

For years I've always set goals in terms of money *input*. In `x` years I should be making `y` dollars. This has been useful, and provided me with some bar to leap over. It has definitely *not* provided me with anything remotely resembling "financial independence"
