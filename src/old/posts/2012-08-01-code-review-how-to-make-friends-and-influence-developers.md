I'm a huge fan of peer review, especially with Atlassian's [Crucible](http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/overview) tool. It can be hard to introduce code review to a group that isn't used to doing it, or has had bad experiences with "hostile" review process in the past. It can be a very effective way to share knowledge and increase quality of a codebase, assuming a few rules are followed.

This is a deck that I like to present to groups that don't have a lot of collective experience with peer review for code. It provides some guidelines that I have harvested from various sources as well as my own experience.
